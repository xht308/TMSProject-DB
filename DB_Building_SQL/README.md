# Explanation of different DB building file versions



## What is going on?
In order to make the database more compatible with imported ontology and achieve more flexibility in data management we are moving our DB to an IRI-based structure which means all artifacts and tracelinks will be uniquely identified by their IRI rather than their ID. The main part of work was finished but more time is still needed for us to add some data and check whether it can work properly.
## Why there are multiple versions?
Because the new version of database based on IRI identification is not completed yet, we will still provide the old version DB for other group members to use without disturbing their developing process.
## Should you switch to the newer version of DB (IRI)?
Yes. In the future, all new futures will be firstly developed on the new version of DB while they can be missing on the old version of DB (ID). For now, you can use the old version of DB from development and we will still provide some coming key futures for it. However, switch to the newer version after it is fully developed will be a good choice.
